# RDF Primer

RDF is a data model for describing things in a manner that allows for open extension, easy merging of data, built on 
the same concepts as the web itself and which allows for the inference of facts from those asserted. This data model 
is abstract in the sense that it is described entirely based upon its semantics and not on its syntax. Multiple 
serialization forms, representations, are described for RDF data but none describe RDF itself. 

This brief primer introduces enough to get started on understanding the RDFtk set of crates and more details will be
introduced in crate-specific sections. There is a more complete [W3C RDF Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/) 
that has a lot more information than presented here.

## Resources, Statements, and Literals

The data model for RDF is surprisingly simple, the core component of which is the **Statement**. A statement asserts
a fact based on the linguistic form *subject* *predicate* *object* (property will sometimes be used instead of the more
formal predicate). Examples might be:

* *Simon* *authored* *this*
* <<https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-rdftk.git>> *is-a* *repository*
* <<http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core>> *description* "The core data model."

This structure can be more formally described as:

1. The **Subject** of a statement is a **Resource** which is either addressed with an [IRI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987)
(Internationalized Resource Identifiers), or an internally generated identifier commonly known as a **Blank Node**.
1. The **Predicate** is some relationship between the subject and object and is always an IRI. 
1. The **Object** of a statement is either a resource or a **Literal**. In the case of a resource the same details apply as
for the subject. 
1. A **Literal** is a string value that may have an associated **Language** *or* **Data Type** but not both.
   1. The language will be expressed as an ISO language identifier, "en", "en_us", etc.
   1. The data type will be expressed as an IRI usually to one of the defined [XML Schema Data Types](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/)
      or a type expressed in XML Schema.

Due to the three parts in each statement a statement may be referred to as a **Triple**.

A collection of statements is a **Graph**, and if this graph itself is addressable (has an IRI itself) it is termed a 
**Named Graph**. This inherently graph nature means that RDF stores and graph stores such as AWS Neptune are a great 
match.

### Visually

It is common in RDF documents to see diagrams representing a statement such as that below. The predicate will be shown 
as a directed, and annotated, arrow from subject to object. This is similar to Chen's notation for [entityâ€“relationship 
modeling](http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~chen/pdf/Chen_Pioneers.pdf), and as such demonstrates RDF's natural style in describing
data.

It is important to note that all predicates are directional implying that a bi-directional, or **Symmetric** relationship 
requires two predicates -- see [Vocabulary Descriptions](#vocabulary-descriptions) below.

<div class="caption figure">1.2: An RDF Statement</div>

To visually distinguish between named resources, blank nodes, and literals, the following conventions will be used.

1. Named resources will be shown as large ovals, their inner name is some short form of the resource's IRI.
1. Blank nodes will be shown as small ovals usually with no inner name (as they are effectively anonymous).
1. Literals will be shown as rectangles; their content may, or may not, be shown in double quotes.

The following is a pretty good representation of the complete RDF data model, hopefully most of which will be clear by
the end of this primer.

## An Annotated Example

As a simple, and easy to approach, example let us consider the `Cargo.toml` file for the core crate. This is a set of 
facts stated about a Cargo crate, and we will work up to an RDF representation of it.

```toml
[package]
name = "rdftk_core"
version = "0.1.10"
authors = ["Simon Johnston <johnstonskj@gmail.com>"]
edition = "2018"
description = "The core data model."
documentation = "https://docs.rs/rdftk_core/"
repository = "https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-rdftk.git"
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"
publish = true

[dependencies]
error-chain = "0.12.2"
unique_id = "0.1.3"
rdftk_iri = { version = "0.1.2", path = "../rdftk_iri" }
rdftk_names = { version = "0.1.5", path = "../rdftk_names" }
```

First, let's start with a single statement, we will assert that a resource, identified as `rdftk:core`, is related to 
a resource, identified as `cargo:crate`, with the relationship `rdf:type`. The astute reader will notice that these
names appear to be namespaced, `type` in the namespace `rdf` for example, and this is true. Namespaces, or vocabularies, 
are described below. Note, the shading of the subject node in this case is simply to anchor the examples, it has no 
additional meaning.

<a name="fig_1_4"></a>![A Statement](img/primer-statement.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.4: A Statement</div>

Given this simple start we can begin adding other attributes from the *package* section of the file. These additional
properties are literal values, so they have been drawn as rectangles. In this primer we will always show literal values
in quotes, this is not necessary but adds clarity.

<a name="fig_1_5"></a>![Properties as Statements](img/primer-props.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.5: Properties as Statements</div>

When we get to the attribute `publish` however we want to express that this is a boolean value and not just a string. 
To do this we add a data type from the XML Schema Datatypes (XSD) standard to the literal value, as shown below.

<a name="fig_1_6"></a>![Typing a Property](img/primer-datatype.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.6: Typing a Property</div>

This kind of type annotation can also be applied to a resource, if that resource has an `rdf:type` predicate, thus 
saving an arrow in the diagram. The different forms of annotation can be seen in the following figure. As it is common 
to not show the identifier for a blank node the annotation is the only value shown.

<a name="fig_1_7"></a>![Type Annotations](img/primer-annotations.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.7: Type Annotations</div>

Sometimes we want to have a resource with multiple predicates, but without the strong identity of an IRI. To do this 
we use blank nodes, nodes that have an internally generated, and therefore not externally addressable, identity. For
example, we could choose to break up the string value for the `authors` property into separate name and email, but don't 
want to give this representation an IRI.

<a name="fig_1_8"></a>![An Anonymous Subject](img/primer-bnode.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.8: An Anonymous Subject</div>

However, the actual attribute `authors` is a TOML list, and we have just added a single predicate relationship. In RDF
it is perfectly reasonable, and frankly quite common, to simply allow multiple predicate instances. 

<a name="fig_1_9"></a>![Multiple Predicate Values](img/primer-multiples.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.9: Multiple Predicate Values</div>

However, what is the semantic meaning of this? are these all authors, is there implied ordering? To this end RDF has
a number of collection structures, **List**, **Seq**uence, **Alt**ernatives, and **Bag** that model linked lists,
ordered lists, a list of alternatives, and an unordered collection. For a good description of RDF collections, see the 
blog post [Ordered Data in RDF](https://ontola.io/blog/ordered-data-in-rdf/).

For our example, we choose to model the `authors` attribute as an RDF sequence, the sequence itself is a blank node 
containing other blank nodes from the previous author example.

<a name="fig_1_10"></a>![Collections](img/primer-seq.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.10: Collections</div>

Finally, the real power of the RDF data model is that both subject and object can be resources, and in particular named
resources, and we can therefore link statements via these. For example; let us assume that the `crates.io` site also
describes users in RDF, now we can model our author predicate to *either* a blank node as shown above, or a named
user by using their IRI. In this example the two sub-graphs are managed by different services, but the ubiquitous use
of the IRI as an identifier means the two are inherently linked.

<a name="fig_1_11"></a>![Linking Statements](img/primer-linkage.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.11: Linking Statements</div>

This is an important consideration as RDF adheres to the [*Open-World Assumption*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption)
the implication of which is that the same IRI may be the subject of a sub-graph elsewhere, and that the graphs may in
fact contradict each other.

### Statements about Statements

A great advantage of both the flexibility of the RDF data model, and the open-world assumption, is that we can make 
statements about other statements. Why is this useful? Think about the following "*Joe said, Jane said something*", Joe is the
subject of a statement, "said" is the predicate, but the object is a statement; in this case we can infer that this
is second-hand information. This means that both data and metadata as well as data and provenance information can all 
be described in the same language and at the same level (no getting lost in meta- and meta-meta- languages).

So, let's take a look at at how this works, because if we look at figure 1.12 you can see we have an issue, how do we
attach the outer *said* predicate to complete inner statement?

<a name="fig_1_12"></a>![Statements about Statements](img/primer-reify-before.png)
<div class="caption figure">1.12: Statements about Statements</div>

The answer is a procedure called *Reification* (which the dictionary describes as *to consider or represent 
(something abstract) as a material or concrete thing*) that turns a single statement into an entity on it's own. To 
accomplish this, simply follow these steps:

1. Create a new blank node as the subject for the following.
1. Create a statement with the predicate `rdf:type` and object `rdf:Statement`.
1. Create a statement with the predicate `rdf:subject` and object being the original statement's subject.
1. Create a statement with the predicate `rdf:predicate` and object being the original statement's predicate.
1. Create a statement with the predicate `rdf:object` and object being the original statement's object.

With this in place we can create new statements whose object is the new blank node, as shown below.

## Representations

As mentioned above, RDF does not dictate a representational form, although the early RDF specifications used XML as an
example or canonical form. Today there are a number of common representations with RDF/XML, JSON-LD, NT/NQ, N3, and 
Turtle/Trig being the most common. Some vocabularies have their own specific representational forms, but that is outside our
scope here. Most of the examples in this document will use Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language), but we will take our last 
example from Joe and Jane and show some different forms.

## Vocabulary Descriptions

While the term *Schema* is often used in conjunction with RDF the term is problematic for software folks as it has
unfortunate connotations. For example, a database schema restricts the data that exists within its tables, a class in 
a programming language restricts the shape of instances. In both of these cases the schema has a closed-world assumption
that it can validate the shape of things and that no things exists outside of schema control.

### Common Vocabularies

The following are a number of vocabularies often used when making statements, or used to develop our own vocabularies.

* [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) itself (used below).
* [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) the original way to describe RDF vocabularies (used below).
* [XML Schema Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/) not truly and RDF vocabulary but adopted as the data type
  specification for RDF literals (used below).
* [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) the web ontology language is a much more complete way to describe vocabularies
  ands uses parts of RDF Schema but goes way beyond it in terms of its ability to support inferencing.
* [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/) A commonly used vocabulary for defining metadata
  and annotations (used below).
* [FOAF: Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) an older vocabulary used to create network of social connections.
* [PROV-O The PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) A vocabulary for asserting provenance about subjects.
* [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) A vocabulary for the development of thesauri.

### Example Vocabulary Mapping

Below is a mapping from the TOML file (left two columns) to predicates we will reuse or invent. 

| Section | Attribute | Predicate | Restriction |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | -----------
| package | name  | `dcterms:identifier` | |
|         | version | `semver:version` | |
|         | authors | `dcterms:contributor` | multiples |
|         | author/name | `foaf:name` | |
|         | author/email | `foaf:mbox` | |
|         | author/image | `foaf:depiction` | |
|         | edition | `cargo:edition` | |
|         | description | `dcterms:description` | |
|         | documentation | `crate:documentation` | |
|         | repository    | `crate:repository` | |
|         | license | `dcterms:license` | |
|         | readme  | `cargo:readme` | |
|         | publish | `cargo:publish` | |
| features | | `dcterms:has_part` | blank node |
|          | *name* | `dcterms:identifier` | |
|          | *parts* | `dcterms:requires` | `rdf:Bag` |
| dependencies | | `dcterms:requires` | blank node |
|              | *name* | `dcterms:references` or `dcterms:identifier` | |
|              | version | `semver:matches` |
|              | path | `cargo:path` |

> Note that we use `foaf:name`, `foaf:mbox`, and `foaf:depiction` for modeling our user, one might also use the PROV-O
> Person class which also has a name and email address. Which to choose sometimes becomes a bit of guesswork, but 
> often depends on any additional semantics one gets with the parts of a vocabulary we decide to use. In this case

> our "*Joe said...*" example above.

In the table above we used two new namespaces `cargo:`, and `semver:`, the following listing is the RDF Schema for 
the Cargo vocabulary we have introduced so far. Note that while we assert that the new entity `cargo:Crate` is **a** 
(the value `a` in this representation is a shortcut for the property `rdf:type`) `rdfs:Class` we do not make assertions 
about the type of the remaining entities. This is where the RDF entailment comes in, the predicates `rdfs:domain` and
`rdfs:range` both have an assertion that `rdfs:domain` is `rdfs:Property` and therefore `edition` to `readme` must be
properties.

## Output Serialization

Here is the complete version of the RDF representation of our crate's metadata. Note that we do not have a type asserted
for the subject which can be implied to be `cargo:Crate` given that it is the `rdfs:domain` of some of the asserted
properties.

            semver:matches      "0.1.5" ;
            cargo:localPath     "../rdftk_names"

## Query

[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is the query language for RDF, and hopefully if you've seen SQL, and 
followed along with this primer so far, the following example should be pretty easy to follow. As there are no tables
and columns the specifics of query matching are different and make use of *basic graph patterns* (BGP)s to match 
statements within a graph. The structure of these patterns is very similar to the syntax we've seen for Turtle, but 
include variables, identifiers that start with "?" or "$". These variables not only determine what is included in the 
projection but also how graph patterns will be matched.

```sparql
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

SELECT ?id ?descr ?ver
WHERE {
    ?s  dcterms:identifier  ?id ;
        dcterms:description ?desc ;
        dcterms:version     ?ver .
} LIMIT 100
```

In this example the variable `?s` is not returned in the projection, however its position in the match denotes the fact 
that the identifier, description, and version all have the same subject regardless of what it is.

> SPARQL has a number of query forms not just `SELECT`; `CONSTRUCT` returns a single RDF graph specified by a graph 
> template, `ASK` to test whether or not a query pattern has a solution, and `DESCRIBE` which returns processor-dependent
> information on the resources required to complete a query.

The `FROM` clause in SPARQL identifies a graph to scope a query, and multiple graphs can be specified to produce results
across them.

```sparql
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

SELECT ?id ?descr ?ver
FROM <https://crates.io/rdf/crates/>
WHERE {
    ?s  dcterms:identifier  ?id ;
        dcterms:description ?desc ;
        dcterms:version     ?ver .
} LIMIT 100
```

A number of SPARQL tutorials exist, and the SPARQL specification itself has many good examples.

### Update

TBD

## Extensions

The following are some commonly used extensions to RDF, some of which may of course be a part of future standards
versions.

### Quads

One issue with RDF is that, in general, the representations do not carry with them any identifier of the graph, or
context, from which they came. Graphs and **Datasets** (collections of graphs) are a part of the broader RDF data model
but this information can be lost along the way. Consider the following subset of our example Cargo file from above. We
know, because we designed it, that these statements exist in the *crates graph* `<https://crates.io/rdf/crates/>` but how
would you know from looking at this?

```turtle
<http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core> 
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier> 
  "rdftk_core" .
<http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core> 
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/version> 
  "0.1.10" .
```

To allow the transport of this graph identifier the N-Triples language has been extended into [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/)
by allowing for an optional IRI or blank node as the fourth element in a serialized statement. 

```turtle
<http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core> 
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier> 
  "rdftk_core" 
  <https://crates.io/rdf/crates/> .
<http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core> 
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/version> 
  "0.1.10" 
  <https://crates.io/rdf/crates/> .
```

Similarly, the Turtle language has been extended into [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/) which defines a syntax that 
wraps a set of statements in braces preceded by a graph identifier.

```turtle
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<https://crates.io/rdf/crates/>
  {
    <http://crates.io/crates/rdftk_core>
        dcterms:identifier  "rdftk_core" ;
        dcterms:version     "0.1.10" ;
  }
```

### RDF*

RDF*, or [RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/), is an effort to make the reification of statements more ergonomic
in RDF. The current [specification](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/rdf-star-cg-spec.html) has been implemented by a 
number of frameworks, including RDFtk, and allows for an entire statement to be written in-line in representations such
as Turtle, and expressed directly in SPARQL.

For example, the following is a textual representation of our "*Joe said...*" reification example.

```turtle
_:S1
    a               rdf:Statement ;
    rdf:subject     :Jane ;
    rdf:predicate   :said ;
    rdf:object      "something" .

:Joe    :said       _:S1 .
```

Turtle does however have a short-cut for the representation of the blank node `_:S1` above, which does make the 
example somewhat more readable, but still verbose.

```turtle
:Joe    
    :said [
        a               rdf:Statement ;
        rdf:subject     :Jane ;
        rdf:predicate   :said ;
        rdf:object      "something" .
    ] .
```

RDF* allows the inner statement to be included directly by enclosed within "<<" and ">>", as shown below.

```turtle
:Joe    :said       << :Jane :said "something" >> .
